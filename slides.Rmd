# Guiding Principles of ModernDive

## 1. Blur the lines between lecture and lab

```{r out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/giphy1.gif")
```


---

## 2. Focus on the entire data/science research pipeline

```{r out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hadley.png")
```

---

## 3. It's all about the data

### - Use the `tidyverse` with rich, interesting, open data sets

```{r out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/hadleyphoto.jpg")
```

---

## 4. Use simulation/resampling not probability/large sample approximation

### - Reinforce concepts, not equations, formulas, and probability tables.

```{r out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ht.png")
```

---

## 5. Don’t fence off students from the computation pool, throw them in!

### - Scaffold & support as a good foreign language professor would

```{r out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/giphy2.gif")
```

---

## 6. Complete reproducibility

### - Put it all out there

### - Ultimately the best textbook is one you’ve written yourself

```{r out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/precious.gif")
```

# Student feedback from my Social Statistics course

- "This course was better than any stats course I could have imagined."

- "I can make plots, seriously this is so awesome and I love all the possibilities of `ggplot2`! And I can use `dplyr` to find answers and
interesting things in social data sets. I can conduct statistical analyses, find if results have statistical significance, and find and interpret confidence
intervals."

- "I knew nothing before the course, and I could easily apply these skills to a sociology job now."

- "Learning to code is very beneficial and using R is cost efficient. I would recommend this course to another student. Even
though this course was hard for me, I still enjoyed it."

# What's to come

### - Implement more book formats (epub, Word document, etc.)

### - Allow for easier customization of textbook

### - Add more interactive shiny apps into the book

### - Create Review Questions at chapter ends using open data sources

### - Design and share instructor resources
